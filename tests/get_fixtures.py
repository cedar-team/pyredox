"""
This utility downloads and saves all the sample data models listed on the Redox
documentation website. To run this, run the following  command:

    poetry run python tests/get_fixtures.py

Be mindful that some sample fixtures do not conform to the specification ðŸ™„, so
you may need to make some small modifications to the fixtures after downloading
them. It's annoying but the fastest way is to identify one failure at a time
with the following (with the virtual environment activated):

    pytest --maxfail=1 -vv --ff

The most common discrepancy is a mismatch of float/str values. For example, the
example on the Redox website will have
    "Quantity": {
      "Value": 1,
      "Units": "Unit"
    },
when the Value field should be a string, like this:
    "Quantity": {
      "Value": "1",
      "Units": "Unit"
    },
